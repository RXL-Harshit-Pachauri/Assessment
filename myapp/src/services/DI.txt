Dependency Injection - It is used to allow services and other dependencies to be injected into components
in a modular and hierarchical way.
-----------------------
Angular organizes dependency injection into a tree of injectors. Each Angular module, component, and 
directive can have its own injector, and these injectors are arranged in a hierarchical manner.
There are mainly 2 types of Hierarchical Dependency Injection -

1. Root-Level Injection (Injected in root) - It  is created when the application starts. Services 
provided at this level are available throughout the application.

2.Element Injector/Component Injector - In this, if a service is provided at the component level, 
that instance of the service is only available to the component and its children.

Benefits - 
1.Services can be easily reused across multiple components, reducing code duplication. The same 
instance of a service can be shared across multiple components or different instances depending
on how the service is provided in the hierarchy.

Other Scenarios - 
1. If we use element injector in child component . It will check its providers in all its ancestors. If found,
then returns the instance of the service , else it will check the root injector hierarchy. If does not found any 
provider in root level hierarchy then it returns and throw Null Injector.
